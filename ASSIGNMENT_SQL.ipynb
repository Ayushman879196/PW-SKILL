        "*   **Customer Spending:** The highest spending customer in the sample data was John Doe, with a total expenditure of \\$31.99, followed by Peter Jones (\\$30.00) and Jane Smith (\\$25.50).\n",
        "*   **Popular Categories:** The 'Action' movie category was the most rented with 4 rental transactions, followed by 'Drama' and 'Comedy' categories, both with 2 rentals each.\n",
        "*   **Film Availability:** Both Store ID 1 and Store ID 2 have 4 films in their inventory. Store ID 1 has 1 unrented film, while Store ID 2 has 2 unrented films.\n",
        "*   **Monthly Revenue:** The sample data showed revenue generation only in January 2023, totaling \\$87.49.\n",
        "*   **Renter Activity:** No customers in the sample dataset qualified as \"frequent renters\" (more than 10 rentals in the last 6 months), indicating the sample data is primarily for demonstrating query functionality rather than reflecting real-world high-volume activity.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   The sample data, while sufficient for demonstrating SQL query functionality, is too small to draw meaningful business insights regarding customer behavior, category popularity, or revenue seasonality.\n",
        "*   To perform a more robust analysis, the next step should involve populating the database with a larger and more diverse dataset that reflects realistic rental patterns and customer activity over a longer period.\n"
